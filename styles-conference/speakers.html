        <h3>Aaron Irizarry</h3>
        <h4>DESIGNING A CULTURE OF DESIGN</h4>
        <p>Workplace culture doesn’t start with beanbags, foosball tables, or a beer fridge, and it doesn’t end with
          neckties, PCs,
          or big corporations. It’s the unwritten rules, behavior, beliefs, and the motivations that enable good work to
          get done,
          or it’s what stifles a workforce. For design to be most effective and for designers to feel valued, we need to
          work in a
          culture that embraces design and allows it to succeed.</p>
        <p>In Aaron’s session he will explore how to recognize the traits of organizations that *get* design, both large
          and small.
          He will share what those teams, departments, and companies have that others don’t, and more importantly, how
          to begin to
          change your own workplace’s culture. Once you’ve worked within a culture of design it’s almost impossible to
          imagine
          yourself anywhere else.</p>
        <h4>ABOUT AARON</h4>
        <p>Aaron Irizarry is a Senior Product Designer for Nasdaq OMX, a lover of heavy metal, a foodie, and a master of
          BBQ arts.

        <h4>LIGHTS! CAMERA! INTERACTION! DESIGN INSPIRATION FROM FILMMAKERS</h4>
        <p>Films succeed in evoking responses and engaging audiences only with a combination of well-written narrative
          and
          effective storytelling technique. It’s the filmmaker’s job to put this together. To do so they’ve developed
          processes,
          tools and techniques that allow them to focus attention, emphasize information, foreshadow and produce the
          many elements
          that together comprise a well-told story</p>
        <p>With this workshop, we’ll revisit the topic of using stories in design and expand on the technical aspects
          used in film
          to communicate. We’ll look at some tools used in film, such as cinematic patterns, beat sheets, and
          storyboards. We’ll
          consider why they’re used and how we might look to them for inspiration.</p>
        <h4>ABOUT ADAM
        </h4>
        <p>Adam Connor is a designer, illustrator and speaker passionate about collaboration, communication, creativity
          and
          storytelling. As an Experience Design Director with Mad*Pow, Adam combines 10+ years of experience in
          interaction and
          experience design with a background in computer science, film, and animation to create effective and
          easy-to-use digital
          products and services. He believes that no matter how utilitarian a tool is, at the core of its creation lies
          a story;
          uncovering that story is key to its success. Occasionally, he shares his perspectives on design at

        <h4>DEATH TO WIREFRAMES: LONG LIVE RAPID PROTOTYPING</h4>
        <p>Static wireframes are a drag on the whole design process. Prototyping makes things a little better by
          allowing you to
          stitch together static wireframes or mockups while adding basic interactions. Rapid prototyping with HTML,
          CSS, and
          JavaScript is even better and faster; it increases collaboration and improves the iteration process. Kill your
          wireframes. Long live rapid prototyping.</p>
